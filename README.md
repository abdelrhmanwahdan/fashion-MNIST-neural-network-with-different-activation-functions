# fashion MNIST neural network with different activation functions
in this project I am analyzing cleaning and visualizing the Fashion MNIST data set then after that I am doing classification on it using neural networks by the following steps:
1. Data wrangling (Data gathering , Data assessing , Data cleaning).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. using different activation functions:
    - selu
    - Prelu
    - Leaky
    - relu
    - batch normalization
